CSV Data Analysis with Pandas - 
A simple Python script demonstrating how to import and analyze spreadsheet data using the pandas library.


The motivation behind creating this script was to showcase how to efficiently import and analyze data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. By utilizing the pandas library, the goal was to demonstrate how to perform basic data analysis tasks like printing data, calculating totals, and averages from the imported data.


I built this project to help others understand the process of working with CSV files and performing basic data analysis using pandas. CSV files are commonly used for storing tabular data, and the ability to manipulate and analyze this data is a valuable skill for data scientists, analysts, and developers.


This script solves the problem of importing and analyzing CSV data without manually parsing the file. It provides a practical example of how to read data from a CSV file, load it into a pandas DataFrame, and perform basic data analysis tasks, such as printing specific columns, calculating the total sales, and finding the average sales.

Through this project, I gained insights into:
I learned how to read and work with CSV files in Python using the csv module for basic reading and the pandas library for more advanced data manipulation.
DataFrame Operations: I explored fundamental DataFrame operations such as selecting columns, calculating sums, and calculating means using pandas.
Library Integration: I practiced integrating external libraries into my Python scripts, enhancing the capabilities of my programs.
